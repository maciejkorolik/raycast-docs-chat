# NextGPT

Raycast plugin that allows asking questions about Next.js docs using OpenAI APIs. 
- It fetches data from Next.js Github Repository, feeds it into Pinecone Vector DB and creates embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings.
- When using the plugin, user can ask any question and the app will find relevant fragments of Next.js documentation and provide answer based on them.
